        <h2><span style="color: #071C21;">Blending Genres</span></h2>
        <p>The Neighbourhood combines indie pop, alternative rock,
            and electronic influences to create a unique sound.<br> Their
             2013 debut, I Love You., and later albums 
            like Wiped Out! show their skill in blending genres while maintaining
             a distinct, moody atmosphere and introspective lyrics.</p>
        
        <h2><span style="color: #071C21;">Visual and Artistic Approach</span></h2>
        <p>The band is noted for their strong visual identity, using monochrome 
            visuals and distinctive aesthetics in their music videos and album art.<br>
            This cohesive brand enhances their artistic vision and complements their music.</p>
        
        <h2><span style="color: #071C21;">Fan Engagement and Growth</span></h2>
        <p>The Neighbourhoodâ€™s success is also due
            to their active engagement with fans through
            social media and their relatable lyrics.<br>
            This personal connection has helped them build a loyal and dedicated following.</p>
