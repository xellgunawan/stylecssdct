        <h2><span style="color: #071C21;">Evolution of Style</span></h2>
        <p>Arctic Monkeys have evolved their sound from their debut album, 
            Whatever People Say I Am, That's What I'm Not,
             to the more experimental *The Car*.<br>
           Early on, they focused on garage rock and post-punk revival.<br>
           Over time, their music has included elements of psychedelic rock and lounge.</p>
        
        <h2><span style="color: #071C21;">Lyrical Prowess</span></h2>
        <p>Alex Turner’s lyrics are a key part of the band's charm.<br>
           His storytelling and sharp observations make songs like
            “Do I Wanna Know?” and “R U Mine?” stand out, offering insightful takes on modern life 
            with a touch of wit.</p>
        
        <h2><span style="color: #071C21;">Impact on the Rock Genre</span></h2>
        <p>Arctic Monkeys have greatly influenced the rock genre, especially in the UK.<br>
           Their innovative songwriting and production have inspired 
           new rock musicians and helped shape the genre’s development.</p>
